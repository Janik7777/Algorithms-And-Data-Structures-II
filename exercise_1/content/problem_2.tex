\subsection{Problem 2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prove the general lower bound for addressable priority queues of $\Omega$(log n) for deleteMin under
the condition that insert runs in constant time.}

\item \textbf{Why does this bound not have to hold if insert is allowed to consume more time?}

\end{enumerate}
